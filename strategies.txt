In mainp4, we have training and test data separated into np arrays

Variables are, in order: Hour1, Hour2, Hour3, numPosts

Look for blanks

Remove Null island (with lat and lon as 0.0)
Possibly standardize latitude and longitude

First step: Try some regressors on X_tr and y_tr and test on X_te
    Have to deal with latitude and longitude separately because we have to predict 1 feature at a time
    Or use a regressor that can predict the multi-value (we'll look for them)

Next step: Try using graph.txt somehow? It has all the links
We probably need to clean up graph.txt since we have users in graph.txt who are not in the original dataset

Potentially: Median latitude / longitude of users connected to a user as an explanatory variable

Try neural network, since we have so much data (TensorFlow)

We want to try everything both with and without graphs

Cross-validation?
